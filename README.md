Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

$ git pull
Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
Push the branch on github :

$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set-upstream.

You can see all the branches created by using :

$ git branch -a

Add a new remote for your branch :

$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] [name_of_your_new_branch]
Push changes from your commit into your branch :

$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [url]
Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :

$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]
Then you need to apply to merge changes if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :

$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop
Delete a branch on your local filesystem :

$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :

$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
Delete the branch on github :

$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
